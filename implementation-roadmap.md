## 1. Overview & Execution Strategy

### Architecture Principles
- **Two-Repository Strategy**: Independent backend (Node.js/Express) and frontend (React/Vite) repositories
- **Container-First Backend**: Single container with Node.js API server and Ollama process
- **Firebase Integration**: Realtime Database for production, Emulator Suite for development/testing
- **TDD Methodology**: All tasks require failing tests written first, then implementation
- **Contract-First API**: API specifications defined before implementation

### Task Design Philosophy
- **Atomic Tasks**: Each task is self-contained and can be completed in 2-4 hours
- **Self-Sufficient Prompts**: Each task prompt contains all necessary context and specifications
- **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Every task has measurable completion criteria
- **Parallel Execution**: Tasks designed to minimize blocking dependencies
- **Testable Units**: All tasks produce testable, verifiable outputs

### Execution Model
- Tasks can be executed by autonomous coding agents (like Claude Code)
- Each task prompt includes complete technical specifications
- Dependency verification built into task prompts
- Automated testing and validation at each step

---

## 2. Task Architecture & Dependencies

### Dependency Types
1. **Hard Dependencies**: Task B cannot start until Task A is complete
2. **Soft Dependencies**: Task B benefits from Task A but can start independently
3. **Resource Dependencies**: Tasks requiring the same external resources
4. **Interface Dependencies**: Tasks that must align on shared contracts/APIs

### Repository Organization
```
Backend Repository (llm-chat-backend):
├── Foundation Layer (Parallel)
├── Core Services Layer (Sequential within, Parallel across)
├── Integration Layer (Depends on Core Services)
└── Deployment Layer (Depends on Integration)

Frontend Repository (llm-chat-frontend):
├── Foundation Layer (Parallel with Backend Foundation)
├── Core Components Layer (Parallel within, Sequential dependency on Foundation)
├── Integration Layer (Depends on Backend API contracts)
└── Deployment Layer (Parallel with Backend Deployment)
```

---

## 3. Work Streams & Parallel Execution

### Stream A: Backend Foundation & Infrastructure
**Duration**: ~16 hours (4 parallel tasks × 4 hours each)
**Parallel Execution**: All tasks can run simultaneously

### Stream B: Frontend Foundation & Infrastructure
**Duration**: ~16 hours (4 parallel tasks × 4 hours each)
**Parallel Execution**: All tasks can run simultaneously, independent of Stream A

### Stream C: Backend Core Services
**Duration**: ~24 hours (Sequential execution required)
**Dependencies**: Requires Stream A completion

### Stream D: Frontend Core Components
**Duration**: ~20 hours (Mostly parallel within sub-streams)
**Dependencies**: Requires Stream B completion, some tasks depend on Stream C API contracts

### Stream E: Integration & Testing
**Duration**: ~12 hours (Sequential execution)
**Dependencies**: Requires both Stream C and Stream D partial completion

### Stream F: Deployment & Operations
**Duration**: ~8 hours (Parallel execution possible)
**Dependencies**: Requires all previous streams completion

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

**Phase 1 - Foundation (All Parallel)**
- Tasks A1, A2, A3, A4 (Backend Foundation)
- Tasks B1, B2, B3, B4 (Frontend Foundation)

**Phase 2 - Core Development (Sequential within streams, parallel across streams)**
- Stream C: C1 → C2 → C3 → C5 → C6 → C7 (with C4 parallel to C2)
- Stream D: D1 → D2 → (D3, D4 parallel) → D5 → (D6, D7 parallel)

**Phase 3 - Integration (Sequential)**
- Tasks E1 → E2 → E3 → E4

**Phase 4 - Deployment (Mostly Parallel)**
- Tasks F1, F2, F3 (parallel) → F4

## 10. Critical Path Analysis

### Critical Path Duration: ~52 hours
**Path**: A1 → C1 → C2 → C3 → C5 → C7 → E1 → E2 → E3 → E4 → F4

### Optimization Opportunities:
1. **Early API Contract Definition**: Define API contracts after Task C1 to unblock frontend development
2. **Parallel Testing**: Some integration testing can begin before all features are complete
3. **Incremental Deployment**: Deploy components as they're completed rather than waiting for full completion

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Ollama Integration Risk**: Task C6 is not on critical path, providing buffer time
- **Frontend-Backend Coupling**: API contracts defined early to minimize integration delays
- **Testing Dependencies**: Integration tests can use mocked components to start earlier

## 11. Resource Requirements

### Development Environment Requirements:
- **Node.js**: LTS version (18.x or 20.x)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For local development and testing
- **Firebase CLI**: For database emulator and hosting
