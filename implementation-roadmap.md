## 1. Overview & Execution Strategy

### Architecture Principles
- **Two-Repository Strategy**: Independent backend (Node.js/Express) and frontend (React/Vite) repositories
- **Container-First Backend**: Single container with Node.js API server and Ollama process
- **Firebase Integration**: Realtime Database for production, Emulator Suite for development/testing
- **CI/CD-First Approach**: Deployment pipeline established before any feature development
- **Incremental Staging Deployment**: Each milestone deployed to staging for verification
- **TDD Methodology**: All tasks require failing tests written first, then implementation
- **Contract-First API**: API specifications defined before implementation

### Task Design Philosophy
- **Atomic Tasks**: Each task is self-contained with clear completion criteria
- **Self-Sufficient Prompts**: Each task prompt contains all necessary context and specifications
- **Deployment-Ready**: Every task produces code that can be deployed to staging
- **Documentation-First**: All manual setup steps documented for reproducibility
- **Verification-Driven**: Each milestone includes staging environment verification
- **Parallel Execution**: Tasks designed to minimize blocking dependencies

### Execution Model
- **Phase 0 Priority**: CI/CD and staging environment must be operational first
- **Incremental Development**: Features deployed to staging immediately upon completion
- **Continuous Verification**: Coding agents verify functionality through deployed staging environment
- **Manual Step Documentation**: All manual setup procedures documented in task outputs
- **Milestone Gates**: Each phase completion verified through staging environment testing

## 2. Task Architecture & Dependencies

### Dependency Types
1. **Hard Dependencies**: Task B cannot start until Task A is complete
2. **Soft Dependencies**: Task B benefits from Task A but can start independently
3. **Resource Dependencies**: Tasks requiring the same external resources
4. **Interface Dependencies**: Tasks that must align on shared contracts/APIs

### Repository Organization
```
Backend Repository (llm-chat-backend):
├── CI/CD Layer (Phase 0 - First Priority)
├── Foundation Layer (Phase 1 - With staging deployment)
├── Core Services Layer (Phase 2 - Incremental deployment)

## 8. Critical Path Analysis

### Critical Path (CI/CD-First Approach):
**Path**: CI-1,CI-2,CI-3 → INFRA-B1-B4,INFRA-F1-F4 → BACK-1 → BACK-2 → BACK-3 → BACK-5 → FRONT-1 → FRONT-2 → FRONT-5 → INT-1,INT-2,INT-3,INT-4 → DEPLOY-1,DEPLOY-2,DEPLOY-3,DEPLOY-4

### Key Changes from Original Plan:
1. **Phase 0 Priority**: CI/CD infrastructure must be completed before any development work
2. **Staging-First Deployment**: Each milestone immediately deployed to staging for verification
3. **Incremental Development**: Features deployed as soon as they're completed and tested
4. **Continuous Verification**: Manual and automated testing performed on staging after each deployment

### Optimization Opportunities:
1. **Immediate Verification**: Staging deployment enables immediate functionality testing
2. **Parallel Development**: Backend and frontend foundation tasks can run in parallel after Phase 0
3. **Early Integration**: API contracts tested on staging environment as soon as backend is deployed
4. **Risk Reduction**: Issues identified early through continuous staging deployment

### Risk Mitigation:
- **CI/CD First**: Deployment issues identified and resolved before feature development
- **Staging Verification**: All functionality verified in deployed environment before production
- **Incremental Approach**: Smaller deployments reduce risk of integration failures
- **Documentation Requirements**: Manual setup procedures documented to ensure reproducibility
