## 1. Overview

- **TDD practices** where tests drive implementation
- **API contracts** established before development
- **80% code coverage** for critical paths
- **Parallel development** enabled by contracts
- **Zero integration failures** from contract mismatches

---

## 2. TDD Implementation

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle
1. **Red**: Write failing test for expected behavior
2. **Green**: Write minimum code to pass test
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

### TDD Rules
- No production code without failing test
- Tests drive design and architecture
- Focus on one behavior per test
- Fast feedback loop with quick test execution

---

## 3. API Contract-First Development

### Contract Definition Process

#### Specification Before Implementation
- Define OpenAPI/Swagger specifications before any code
- Include all request/response schemas, status codes, and headers
- Document authentication requirements and error responses
- Version contracts with semantic versioning

#### Collaborative Contract Design
- Frontend and backend teams jointly define contracts
- Review and approve contracts before development begins
- Use contracts as the source of truth for API behavior
- Store contracts in version control with the code

#### Contract Evolution Strategy
- Maintain backward compatibility for minor versions
- Deprecate features with clear migration paths
- Document breaking changes in major versions
- Provide compatibility matrices for different versions

### Contract Testing Approach

#### Schema Validation
- Validate all requests against defined schemas
- Ensure responses match contract specifications
- Test both success and error response formats
- Verify optional and required field handling

#### Behavioral Contract Testing
- Test API behavior beyond just schema compliance
- Verify business rule enforcement
- Ensure consistent error handling
- Validate pagination and filtering behavior

#### Cross-Team Contract Testing
- Frontend tests against contract-generated mocks
- Backend tests validate contract compliance
- Integration tests verify actual compatibility
- Contract tests run in CI/CD pipeline

### Contract Management

#### Version Control
- Store contracts alongside code in repositories
- Tag contract versions with releases
- Maintain changelog for contract modifications
- Archive deprecated contract versions

#### Breaking Change Protocol
- Identify breaking changes through automated tools
- Require explicit approval for breaking changes
- Provide migration guides for breaking changes
- Support multiple API versions during transition

## 4. Frontend-Backend Integration Strategy

### Parallel Development Enablement

#### Mock-First Development
- Generate mock servers from API contracts
- Frontend develops against contract-compliant mocks
- Backend implements to match contract specifications
- No blocking dependencies between teams

#### Shared Contract Repository
- Centralized location for all API contracts
- Automated type generation for both teams
- Contract validation tools for local development
- Change notifications for contract updates

### Integration Testing Approach

#### Contract Compliance Testing
- Both teams test against the same contracts
- Automated validation of contract adherence
- Cross-team integration test suites
- Early detection of integration issues

#### Progressive Integration
- Start with mock integration tests
- Progress to real backend integration
- Maintain both mock and real test suites
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout

### Communication Protocol

#### API Change Management
- Propose changes through contract modifications
- Review process for contract changes
- Impact analysis before implementation
- Coordinated deployment of changes

#### Error Handling Standardization
- Consistent error response format
- Shared error code definitions
- Unified validation message structure
- Common pagination patterns

## 7. Developer Workflow & Practices

### TDD Development Flow

#### Feature Development Process
1. Review and understand requirements
2. Define API contract if applicable
3. Write failing test for first requirement
4. Implement code to pass the test
5. Refactor while keeping tests green
6. Repeat for next requirement
7. Run full test suite before committing

#### Bug Fixing Process
1. Write failing test that reproduces the bug
2. Verify test fails for the right reason
3. Fix the bug to make test pass
4. Verify no regression in other tests
5. Add edge case tests if needed
6. Document the fix in test description

### Code Review Guidelines

#### Test Review Criteria
- Tests exist for all new functionality
- Tests are clear and well-named
- Tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- No test interdependencies
- Appropriate use of mocks and stubs

#### Coverage Review
- New code has adequate test coverage
- Edge cases are tested
- Error paths are covered
- Integration points are tested

### Local Development Testing

#### Test Execution Strategy

- Execute integration tests before committing
- Use test watchers for immediate feedback
- Maintain fast test execution times
