## State Management
```typescript
interface ThreadStore {
  threads: Thread[];
  activeThreadId: string | null;
  isLoading: boolean;
  hasMore: boolean;
  loadThreads: () => Promise<void>;
  loadMoreThreads: () => Promise<void>;
  createThread: (title?: string) => Promise<Thread>;
  deleteThread: (threadId: string) => Promise<void>;
  selectThread: (threadId: string) => void;
}
```

## Responsive Design
- Collapsible sidebar on mobile
- Drawer/overlay behavior for small screens
- Touch-friendly interaction targets

- Debounced search functionality
- Lazy loading of thread metadata
- Efficient re-rendering on thread updates

## Deliverables
- Complete thread sidebar with list view
- Thread creation and deletion functionality
- Pagination with infinite scroll
- Responsive mobile/desktop layouts
- Thread state management with Zustand
- Performance optimizations for large datasets
